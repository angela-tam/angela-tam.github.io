I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the National University of Singapore. I'm mainly interested in developing neuroimaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. I'm a big fan of open science and open source software. I also like taking photos and I have a passion for bagels.
