Have you ever wanted to run some tissue segmentations or spatial normalization on brain images with SPM12, but you didn't have a MATLAB license? Or did you ever wish that these SPM12 tools could be run in an open source language, perhaps Octave?

If so, check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/angela-tam/octave_spm). This github repository contains a pipeline to interface with SPM12's segmentation and DARTEL tools in Octave and can be deployed on a high performance cluster. This project mainly contains wrappers for some core SPM12 functions.
