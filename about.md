title: About me
---

Currently, I'm a scientist at [Perceiv AI](https://perceiv.ai). I completed my PhD in neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My thesis focused on predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia from heterogeneous patterns of neurodegeneration and functional connectivity with structural and functional MRI. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the National University of Singapore. My postdoc project aimed to predict cognitive abilities, psychiatric symptoms, and personality traits in children with functional MRI. I mainly code in Python and MATLAB/Octave, but I sometimes play with R and SQL. Aside from research, I enjoy listening to podcasts and live music, visiting art galleries, and befriending stray cats.
