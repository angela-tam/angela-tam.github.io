Here's a brief summary of how I built the 3D printed brain lamp that is frequently featured as my website's banner.

Step 1: I used [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to build my model. I had 4 pieces: two brain hemispheres and two wings that would click into the brain with attached pegs.

Step 2: I used [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software) to prepare my model(s) for printing with the [Ultimaker 3](https://ultimaker.com/).
