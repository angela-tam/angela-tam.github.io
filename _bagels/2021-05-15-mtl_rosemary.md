I'm excited to revive my bagel blog now that I am back in Montreal full time. On this sunny spring afternoon, I met up with my friend Diane in Outremont/Mile End aka Montreal bagel central. We grabbed a couple bagels at St-Viateur and hung out at a park. I was very excited to get a rosemary and sea salt bagel. This bagel is a big draw for me to go to St-Viateur specifically because I haven't seen this flavour anywhere else, and I have a lot of fond memories eating this bagel on the metro during my morning commute to my lab during my PhD.

<h3>I got too excited and started eating the bagel before remembering I should take a picture first.</h3>

St-Viateur's rosemary and sea salt bagel has a crunchy crust and it's soft and chewy in the middle. It has an understated yet savoury taste (it is much less sweet compared to their sesame bagels for reference). I also think the texture of the dough is different compared to other bagels in general. Diane mentioned she thought it was maybe doughier. I did some "research" on St-Viateur's website and found that all their bagels contain canola oil, but the rosemary bagel is the only one that contains both canola oil and olive oil. So I'm quite curious now about how the addition of olive oil transforms both the taste and texture of the bagel. I will have to investigate this further the next time I make my own bagels. Anyway, the rosemary and sea salt bagel makes a perfect snack as it is very pleasant and light. This is a 5/5 bagel and a delight to eat every time.

I'm pretty sure this squirrel felt the same because it kept trying to creep over to me and Diane while totally eyeing our bagels.
