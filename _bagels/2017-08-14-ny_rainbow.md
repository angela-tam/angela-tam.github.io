This is actually a belated post, so my memory is a bit fuzzy. Pictured is a rainbow bagel with jalapeno cream cheese from Bagel Brothers in Brooklyn, NY. The rainbow bagel was quite sweet and kind of tasted like a cake. I realize the pairing of the bagel and cream cheese is a bit weird, but I guess I thought the spice from the jalapeno could cut the sweetness of the rainbow. If I was craving a dessert-like bagel, I would order a rainbow bagel again.
