Disclosure: This is actually a belated post, so my memory is a bit fuzzy. While I did eat this bagel in August of 2017, I am actually writing this in April of 2019.

Pictured is a rainbow bagel with jalapeno cream cheese from Bread Brothers Bagel Cafe in Brooklyn, NY. The rainbow bagel was quite sweet and kind of tasted like a cake. I almost felt like I was celebrating a birthday. I realize the pairing of a rainbow bagel and jalapeno cream cheese is a bit weird, but I guess I thought the spice from the jalapeno could cut the sweetness of the rainbow. If I was craving a dessert-like bagel, I would order a rainbow bagel again.

I just want to add that I once ordered an everything bagel with olive cream cheese from Bread Brothers Bagel Cafe and it was the best bagel of my life. I often think about this bagel and I wonder if I will ever find another bagel that tastes as good.
