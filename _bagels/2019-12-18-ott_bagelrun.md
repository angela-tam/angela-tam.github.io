My friend Steph joined me at my first bagel stop in Ottawa, Bagel Run in Orleans. Bagel Run offers Montreal style bagels from a woodburning oven. I ordered an everything bagel with herb and garlic cream cheese (pictured below), while Steph ordered a BLT bagel sandwich.

The bagel was heavily flavoured with sesame. The texture was pretty chewy and doughy - Steph also agreed. I somewhat wish I had gotten plain cream cheese. The herb and garlic cream cheese was very herby and a bit overpowering, so it made judging the taste of the bagel a bit tricky.

The bagel was quite densely seasoned though! Look how pretty the seeds look in this close-up. I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate a bagel that is seasoned on both sides.

I give the everything bagel from Bagel Run a 3.5/5. They have very aesthetically pleasing bagels.

Thanks to Steph for treaing me to the bagel and for joining me on my bagel tour!
