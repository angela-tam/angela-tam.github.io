This summer I am making it my mission to try all of the bagels at Fairmount and St-Viateur. I have plans to try other bagel shops on the island also, but I thought it would be fun to do a series of posts dedicated to the "Fairmount vs St-Viateur" rivalry. So whenever there is a flavour that is offered at both shops, I will be eating and thinking about both the Fairmount and St-Viateur versions side by side. (Plus, the shops are super close to each other so visiting both bakeries in one trip makes the most sense and I get to eat double the amount of bagels in one sitting, so it's a winning situation all around.)

Today's post is about the poppy bagels. My friend Pauline and I spent the hottest yet perhaps breeziest day of the summer so far at Parc Lafontaine dissecting these bagels.

<h3>Fairmount poppy bagel</h3>

The Fairmount poppy bagel was quite sweet and chewy, but didn't have a particularly crisp crust. I always enjoy a bagel that is seasoned everywhere, and Pauline pointed out this makes it perfect for sharing.

<h3>St-Viateur poppy bagel</h3>

As we can see from the picture, the St-Viateur poppy bagel is only half seasoned. I guess the half seasoning gives it a bit of variety because in a way it's like having two half bagels in one: a plain half and a poppy half. The bagel was chewy but didn't really have crisp crust. Compared to the Fairmount bagel, I felt this was less sweet. Pauline thought the texture was lighter and perhaps drier than the Fairmount bagel.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Both Fairmount and St-Viateur bagels are nice light snacks. If you're looking for a stronger poppy flavour, the Fairmount bagel is definitely the one for you between these two bagels.
