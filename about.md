title: About me
---

I'm currently a post doctoral research fellow at the National University of Singapore. I completed my PhD in neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My thesis focused on predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia from heterogeneous patterns of neurodegeneration and functional connectivity with structural and functional MRI. My current work in my post doc looks at predicting psychiatric disorders and symptoms in children with MRI. I mainly code in Python and MATLAB/Octave, but I sometimes play with R and SQL. Outside of the lab, I enjoy listening to podcasts and live music, visiting art galleries, and befriending stray cats.
